### Homework Assignment: Building a React Application with Login/Signup and LocalStorage Authentication

#### Objective
Create a dynamic web application using React that includes a login and signup component. Implement authentication using localStorage and routing with React Router.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Application Design**:
   - Sketch out the layout and identify the components needed.

2. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Initialize a new React project using Vite.
   - Organize your project structure with components, utilities, and assets.

3. **Developing Components**:
   - Build individual React components for login, signup, and the main application content.
   - Use `useEffect` to check if the user is logged in when the component mounts.

4. **Implementing Routing**:
   - Install and set up React Router in your project.
   - Create routes for login, signup, and protected routes for authenticated users.

5. **Implementing Data Persistence**:
   - Use localStorage to save user credentials during signup.
   - Retrieve and verify user credentials during login.
   - Ensure user authentication status persists across page reloads and sessions.

6. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test your application thoroughly to ensure all components work as expected.
   - Optimize and refine your code and UI for better performance and user experience.

### Deliverables
Submit the following:
- Your React project folder containing all relevant components and configuration files.
- A README file detailing your approach, the use of localStorage for authentication, and any other necessary documentation.
